    What you'll get:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personalised research on the potential social returns of different project ideas, such as our overview of <a href="/blog/2016/01/04/digital-financial-services-for-the-poor-shallow-overview">digital financial services for the poor</a>.</li>
    <li>Strategic advice, including problem selection heuristics, and project design and evaluation. Take a look at some high-level heuristics <a href="/blog/2016/06/25/high-level-considerations">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Connection with <a href="/blog/2016/06/11/interview-with-alex-demarsh">experts</a> in socially important domains, so you can benefit from what's already known about the problem.</li>
    <li>A friendly sounding-board for ideas.</li>
  </ul>

    <h1>Important problems to work on</h2>
    <p>Our initial research suggests these problems are promising. However, this is an early draft so we can't yet explicitly recommend working in one of these areas.<p>

          <li>Tractability: There are <a href="http://bluedot.global/">operating</a> <a href="http://www.epidemico.com/">businesses</a> in this area. However, it’s difficult to know what interventions will work best and difficult to get feedback on whether you are successfully helping prevent outbreaks.</li>
          <li>Neglectedness: Government departments, such as the US CDC, international organisations, such as WHO, and academics are also working on this.</li>

Helping these people achieve even a small boost to their ability to buy what they need can have a very large impact on their lives.</li>
          <li>Tractability: Because of the rise of mobile money it’s now possible for startups to build financial business to serve many poor people even when they don’t have a bank account.</li>
          <li>Neglectedness: There is huge inequality of access to financial services. However, there is already a lot of work currently trying to fix this, including <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor">funding from the Gates Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.sendwave.com">many</a> <a href="https://branch.co/">private</a> <a href="http://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/do-more-with-m-pesa/m-shwari">companies</a>.</li>
