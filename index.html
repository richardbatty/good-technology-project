      <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Natural pandemics have historically killed millions of people and caused widespread suffering.</p>

<p>Advances in biotechnology<sup id="fnref:advances_in_biotechnology"><a href="#fn:advances_in_biotechnology" class="footnote">1</a></sup> have opened up the possibility of novel diseases being accidentally or deliberately released, and these could cause more harm<sup id="fnref:more_harm"><a href="#fn:more_harm" class="footnote">2</a></sup> than natural diseases.</p>

<h2 id="biosurveillance-as-a-possible-solution">Biosurveillance as a possible solution</h2>

<p>The field of biosurveillance aims to help with detecting and tracking outbreaks of disease<sup id="fnref:what_is_biosurveillance"><a href="#fn:what_is_biosurveillance" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and is one component of improving biosecurity<sup id="fnref:biosurveillance_for_biosecurity"><a href="#fn:biosurveillance_for_biosecurity" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. It has two aims:<sup id="fnref:two_aims_of_biosurveillance"><a href="#fn:two_aims_of_biosurveillance" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Early event detection - detect as early as possible events that suggest a public health emergency</li>
  <li>Situational awareness - to help response to outbreak and monitor it’s progress</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-you-could-build">What you could build</h2>

<h3 id="the-parts-of-a-typical-biosurveillance-system">The parts of a typical biosurveillance system</h3>

<p>To work out what you might build, it’s helpful to see the parts of a typical biosurveillance system:<sup id="fnref:parts"><a href="#fn:parts" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/parts_of_biosurveillance_system.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>

<p>We’ll explore what you could build for each part.</p>

<h3 id="data-collection">Data collection</h3>

<h4 id="syndromic-surveillance">Syndromic surveillance</h4>

<p>Syndromic surveillance<sup id="fnref:syndromic_surveillance"><a href="#fn:syndromic_surveillance" class="footnote">7</a></sup> systems look for leading indicators of a disease outbreak. Unlike traditional health surveillance, which relies on confirmed cases of a disease, such a system may, for example, look for an increase in individuals presenting with sore-throats in a particular area.<sup id="fnref:syndromic_vs_traditional"><a href="#fn:syndromic_vs_traditional" class="footnote">8</a></sup> In theory, this can help spot an outbreak before the traditional methods do.</p>

<h4 id="data-from-medical-records">Data from medical records</h4>

<p>Data from hospital medical records could be pulled into a more centralised public health monitoring system at local, national, or international levels. This could be used to detect changes in patterns of diseases that are diagnosed in the records. Alternatively, the symptoms mentioned in the records could be analysed to detect misdiagnoses of rare diseases that could have a big impact on public health. As <a href="http://goodtechnologyproject.org/blog/2016/06/11/interview-with-alex-demarsh">Alex Demarsh says</a> “One issue biosurveillance people think about a lot is the fact that doctors are told ‘When you see hoofprints think horses not zebras’. But in biosurveillance we’re looking for those zebras, unusual cases that could be the beginning of something bigger.”</p>

<p>However, it could be very difficult to access this data both because of regulations for patient privacy and because the IT systems that hospitals use may be very difficult to work with.</p>

<h4 id="participatory-surveillance">Participatory surveillance</h4>

<p>It’s possible to gather data from individuals about health around them. <a href="https://flunearyou.org/">Flu near you</a> is an example of this. If you build a system that can consistently get good data in different regions, you could then use it to enhance surveillance in high-risk areas or during an emergency. For example, <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report/95878/philippines-texting-help-and-health-disaster-response">the WHO helped set up</a> an SMS-based surveillance system for use during and after typhoons.</p>

<h4 id="web-scraping">Web-scraping</h4>

<p>Scraping data from online news sites and social media can catch outbreaks before traditional methods. An example of this is the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/alertresponse/epidemicintelligence/en/">GPHIN system</a>, which proved useful during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome?oldformat=true">SARS</a> outbreak. According to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2687026/">this paper</a> “GPHIN’s information was ≈2–3 days ahead of the official WHO report of confirmed and probable cases worldwide.”</p>

<h4 id="data-on-factors-that-can-affect-spread">Data on factors that can affect spread</h4>

<p>For example, human movement data can help with predicting the spread of many diseases; weather and landscape data can help when studying vector-borne diseases. <sup id="fnref:context_data"><a href="#fn:context_data" class="footnote">9</a></sup> For example, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Seth_Britch2/publication/221495666_Environmental_Biosurveillance_for_Epidemic_Prediction_Experience_with_Rift_Valley_Fever/links/554a3a3c0cf21ed21358e0c8.pdf">this paper</a> describes a system designed to warn of climate conditions favourable for an outbreak of the mosquito-born Rift Valley fever. As another example, much of <a href="http://bluedot.global/work">Bluedot’s work</a> is on the spread of diseases (such as flu, ebola, and dengue) via global airline transport.</p>

<h3 id="data-management">Data management</h3>

<h4 id="connect-together-multiple-data-sources">Connect together multiple data sources</h4>

<p><a href="http://goodtechnologyproject.org/blog/2016/06/11/interview-with-alex-demarsh">Alex Demarsh says</a> “We need interoperable systems that can talk to one another. We need to be able to link together e.g. survey data, administrative data, environmental data, road networks, and maybe vector populations and movements. One thing that makes this difficult is that data is often hard to move between administrative units (such as states or provinces). This data infrastructure would help us to predict the spread of disease and would support decision making on how to handle an outbreak.”</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>Detecting an initial outbreak of disease is not enough. You also need to be able to judge whether a report indicates an outbreak, and if there’s an outbreak whether it’s likely to be important. Historically, predicting the importance of an outbreak has been very difficult.<sup id="fnref:failed_disease_prediction"><a href="#fn:failed_disease_prediction" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

<h4 id="better-tools-for-communicating-to-decision-makers">Better tools for communicating to decision-makers</h4>

<p><a href="http://goodtechnologyproject.org/blog/2016/06/11/interview-with-alex-demarsh">Alex Demarsh mentions</a> that “It would also be good to make it easier to communicate results of surveillance an analysis to non-technical and non-scientific people who have to make decisions. We need better tools for communicating data effectively to people in government who make decisions on how to respond. Often agencies have to search manually through data when there would be ways to make that process a lot quicker using better software”</p>

<h2 id="which-diseases-should-you-concentrate-on">Which diseases should you concentrate on?</h2>

<p>To make progress, you’ll need to start by working on a disease that has outbreaks often enough that you can test your system. Ideally you’d also work with a disease that is globally important, which will often mean diseases that are most prevalent in the developing world. See <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/50/21701.full.pdf">Chan et al. 2010</a> for data on outbreak frequency in different regions.</p>

<p>One good option would be flu. <a href="http://goodtechnologyproject.org/blog/2016/06/11/interview-with-alex-demarsh">According to Alex Demarsh</a>  “In general, influenza is a good disease to work on as a lot of people die of it each year, there’s a risk of an influenza pandemic, and there’s a lot of data on it.”</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of working on detecting outbreaks of currently important diseases, you could work on detecting new diseases. According to <a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/12/1636.full">this paper</a> “The majority of all human infectious diseases and pandemics have originated through the cross-species transmission of microorganisms from animals to humans, overwhelmingly in the Old World.” An example of this is HIV - according to the same paper “It is now generally accepted that the hunting and butchering of wild nonhuman primates in the early 20th century led to the introduction of simian immunodeficiency virus into the human population, giving rise to our modern day HIV pandemic.” If we had detected the early spread of HIV or the even earlier transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus into humans we would have been decades earlier than the <a href="https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/aids-timeline/">discovery of AIDS in the 80s</a>. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nathan_wolfe_hunts_for_the_next_aids?language=en">This TED talk</a> is a useful introduction to this issue.</p>

<h2 id="commercial-viability">Commercial viability</h2>

<p>We’re not sure how easy it is to build a viable business in this area. There are existing companies such as <a href="http://www.epidemico.com/">Epidemico</a>, <a href="http://bluedot.global/">BlueDot</a>, and <a href="http://metabiota.com/">Metabiota</a> but it’s unclear from reading their websites how their business model works. A good next step would be to reach out to these companies and talk to them about their businesses and where they think there are gaps.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-of-potential-impact">Evaluation of potential impact</h2>

<p>Based on the Open Philanthropy Project’s <a href="http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity">research on the topic</a>, we think that the biosecurity and pandemic preparedness is an important cause area. However, we’re unsure of how effective biosurveillance is at tackling this and have not looked into this question in depth. A discussion of the effectiveness of biosurveillance can be found <a href="http://faculty.nps.edu/rdfricke/docs/Encyclopedia%20Article.pdf#page=7">here</a>.</p>

<p>As well as looking at empirical work on the impact of biosurveillance, you could look at existing modelling of interventions to prevent disease spread to see if biosurveillance systems could affect some of the model parameters.</p>

      <p>Nouri and Chyba, 2008:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Biotechnological power is increasing exponentially, reminiscent of the increase in computing power since the invention of electronic computers. The co­ founder of Intel Corporation, Gordon Moore, pointed out in 1965 that the number of transistors per computer chip - a measure of how much computation can be done in a given volume - has doubled roughly every 18 months (Moore, 1965). This exponential increase in computing power, now called ‘Moore’s Law’, has continued to hold in the decades since then (Lundstrom, 2003) and is the reason that individuals now have more computing power available in their personal computers than that was available only to the most advanced nations only decades ago. Although biotechnology’s exponential lift off began decades after that of computing, its rate of increase, as measured, for example, by the time needed to synthesize a given DNA sequence, is as fast or faster than that of Moore’s Law (Carlson, 2003). Just as Moore’s Law led to a world of personal computing and home appliance microprocessors, so biotechnological innovation is moving us into a world where the synthesis of DNA, as well as other biological manipulations, will be increasingly available to small groups of technically competent and even individual users.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>There is already a list of well-known experiments - and many others that have received less public attention - that illustrates the potential dangers intrinsic to modern biological research and development. We review several examples of these in some detail below, including: genetic manipulations that have rendered certain viruses far more deadly to their animal hosts (Jackson et al., 2001); the synthesis of polio virus from readily purchased chemical supplies (Cello et al., 2002) - so that even if the World Health Organization (WHO) succeeds in its important task for eradicating polio worldwide, the virus can be reconstituted in laboratories around the world; the reduction in the time needed to synthesize a virus genome comparable in size to the polio virus from years to weeks; the laboratory re-synthesis of the 1918 human influenza virus that killed tens of millions of people worldwide (Tumpey et al., 2005); the discovery of ‘RNA interference’, which allows researchers to turn off certain genes in humans or other organisms (Sen et al., 2006); and the new field of ‘synthetic biology’, whose goal is to allow practitioners to fabricate small ‘biological devices’ and ultimately new types of microbes (Fu, 2006).</p>

        <p>pressures from natural selection limit the destructive potential of pathogens. Synthetic biology can overcome these natural limits, allowing pandemics of unprecedented scale. Particularly worrying is a combination of high lethality, high infectiousness, and long incubation periods: properties that can occur individually in nature, but would cause a global catastrophe if combined.”</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Surveillance is the ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of health data. All public health institutions do this. It involves going out and collecting data on incidence or prevalence of disease, or on risk factors or precursors to disease. Surveillance systems are useful for early detection of anomalies so that we can act in response. It’s also used for census purposes to look at the stability of disease rates over time and across different regions so that we can decide whether to put more resources into helping one set of people or another.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Within surveillance, biosurveillance is more focussed on computational tools and early detection of outbreaks.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Stronger international disease surveillance systems with better interconnection and more	updated technologies.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Public health systems that can use electronic medical records to detect patterns in	 disease and to manage outbreaks.</p>

        <p>“the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and application of real-time (or near-real-time) indicators of diseases and outbreaks that allow for their detection before public health authorities would otherwise note them” (Sosin, 2003). Thus, syndromic surveillance is epidemiologic surveillance restricted to using leading indicators of disease. In particular, syndromic surveillance is based on the notion of a syndrome which is a set of non-specific pre-diagnosis medical and other information that may indicate the release of a bioterrorism agent or natural disease outbreak.</p>

<p>The 50 Breakthroughs report <a href="https://ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=163">summarises the problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accurate and timely diagnosis increases the likelihood of successful treatment. Diagnostics play a particularly vital role in clinical scenarios where patients present with non-specific symptoms that are common to multiple diseases, or in situations where the specific strain of the disease must be identified to determine the correct treatment regimen. Since many infectious diseases are asymptomatic, diagnostics are necessary for screening asymptomatic patients. This helps prevent long term complications from untreated infections and decreases the rate of disease transmission within communities. Diagnostics are also essential for monitoring treatment effectiveness for chronic diseases like diabetes. Indeed, diagnostics inform and influence 60-70% of healthcare decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, the diagnostics currently on the global market have a number of serious shortcomings for use in resource-poor settings. Most reliable diagnostics require clinical infrastructure, and need to be administered by highly trained healthcare workers; as such, they are not suitable for point-of-care use. Most of the simpler diagnostics that have been deployed on a large scale are proving to be inadequate due to low sensitivity or specificity, and the inability to determine the drug susceptibility of the infecting pathogen. Today, 60% of people in developing countries have access to only poorly equipped, peripheral health clinics. This means that their diagnoses are often unreliable, or they have to incur high out-of-pocket expenses at distant facilities with better equipment and more trained staff.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To meet the needs of these patients, a new generation of innovative diagnostics need to be developed. These tests must be portable and lightweight, capable of operating without grid electricity, be tolerant to high ambient temperature and humidity, be able to withstand physical shock while being transported, and be simple enough to be used by minimally trained healthcare workers at the point-of-care. There are 4 technological breakthroughs which can make that possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pages after this quote have some more detail about the parts of the problem and weaknesses of current methods.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-could-build">What you could build</h2>

<h3 id="tests-for-specific-diseases">Tests for specific diseases</h3>

<p>A test for a globally important disease such as HIV or malaria could have huge impact (see the impact section below). Choosing which one to focus on will depend in large part on your skills and the tractability of the problem.</p>

<p>There are different needs and challenges for each major disease (table from <a href="https://ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=167">here</a>):</p>

<h3 id="components-or-tools-common-to-many-tests">Components or tools common to many tests</h3>

<p>It may be possible to accelerate progress on diagnostic tests for important diseases by creating better technology for use in many of them.</p>

<h4 id="improve-a-diagnostic-method">Improve a diagnostic method</h4>

<p>There are <a href="https://ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=166">several types of diagnostics</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cell-based assays</strong>, which detect whole cells. An example would be tests that count white blood cells for monitoring HIV/AIDS. There are now handheld devices using this method.</li>
  <li><strong>Immunoassays</strong>, which use antibodies to detect protein markers of a disease. There has been good progress on developing low cost versions of these tests for use in the developing world.</li>
  <li><strong>Nucleic acid testing</strong>, which detects pathogen DNA or RNA. These tests are usually complex and expensive, which limits use in the developing world.</li>
  <li><strong>Clinical chemistry assays</strong>, which measure a variety of blood chemistry parameters. There is very little use in the developing world at the point-of-care. It would be useful to develop point-of-care tests because test accuracy reduces when samples are transported to central laboratories.</li>
  <li><strong>Hematology tests</strong>, which measure hemoglobin and hematocrit to test for anemia and measure blood coagulation. There are several point-of-care technologies for this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Making one of these more accessible could help fight several diseases.</p>

<h4 id="make-other-generally-applicable-improvements">Make other generally-applicable improvements</h4>

<p>The following are requirements for diagnostics in minimal infrastructure settings from <a href="http://www.bvgh.org/Portals/0/Reports/2010_the_diagnostics_innovation_map.pdf#page=22">this report</a>. You could work on making progression one of these for one or many diagnostic tests.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/requirements_in_minimal_infrastructure_settings.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>

<p>One additional idea would be to improve sample collection. For example, <a href="http://www.orphidia.com/">Orphidia</a> is a company that makes diagnoses from a drop of blood, meaning that a trained phlebotomist is not required.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<h3 id="scale-of-potential-impact">Scale of potential impact</h3>

<p><a href="http://ajcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/ajcpath/141/1/17.full.pdf">Tayoun et al. (2014)</a> summarise the findings of a Gates Foundation and RAND Corporation study that brought together experts in specific diseases, technology development, and disease modelling to estimate the impact of affordable diagnostics for specific diseases. Their estimates were measured in DALYs, a metric used by the World Health Organisation that can be thought of as one lost year of healthy life (more explanation on this metric can be found <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2014/03/measuring-benefits/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/">here</a>). Their results are summarised in the following graph, which shows the estimated disability adjusted life years that would be saved per year by the introduction of accessible diagnostics.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/diagnostics_dalys_saved.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>

<p>We haven’t looked closely yet at the methodology behind this estimates, but given the source we think it would be difficult to do better than these estimates without a great deal of domain-relevant expertise.</p>

<p>These potential impacts are huge. However, it’s important to remember that your project’s expected impact will likely be significantly lower for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may only solve a part of the problem or only get distribution in a small geographic area</li>
  <li>There is a chance of failure, as in any startup or R&amp;D venture</li>
  <li>If you didn’t do your project, accessible diagnostic tools would eventually get developed. The difference you make is in bringing forward this date.</li>
</ul>

<p>These estimates also help with choosing what to build - judging purely by these estimates it looks like STDs would be the most important diseases to develop diagnostics for. However, which disease you choose will also depend on other factors such as your skills and the business model for your project.</p>

<h3 id="tractability">Tractability</h3>

<h4 id="technical-tractability">Technical tractability</h4>

<p>Our guess is that the technical challenge required in developing accessible diagnostic tests is significant because there are <a href="http://ajcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/ajcpath/141/1/17.full.pdf#page=4">multiple barriers</a> to developing accessible diagnostic technology such as temperature control, access to clean water, difficulty of obtaining some types of samples, and the cost and weight of diagnostic hardware.</p>

<h4 id="deployment-tractability">Deployment tractability</h4>

<p>The 50 breakthroughs report rates the difficulty of deployment for three of their <a href="https://ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=176">suggested diagnostics breakthroughs</a> as ‘extremely challenging’ and the remaining one as ‘complex’. These include difficulties such as regulation, training users, a fragmented market, low existing demand, and a lack of clear business model.</p>

<h3 id="neglectedness">Neglectedness</h3>

<p>We don’t have a good idea of how neglected the specific area of accessible diagnostics is, but it isn’t completely neglected. The Gates Foundation are making <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gates+foundation+diagnostics">grants</a> in this area and there are some companies and nonprofits working on it (see the list at the end of this overview).</p>

<p>In general though, work on developing world problems is very neglected compared to work on developed world problems.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-bottleneck">What’s the bottleneck?</h3>

<p>It only makes sense to start a project if the bottleneck on impact is a lack of good projects and the tech they develop, rather than, for example, a lack of available funding. We don’t know how much this field is constrained by lack of entrepreneurial projects.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps-for-if-youre-interested">Next steps for if you’re interested</h2>

<p>Read the reports linked to in the ‘further reading’ section below to get an idea of the parts of the problem. As you get deeper into this, talk to experts in the field for more information.</p>

<p>As you’re learning about the problem and possible solutions, focus on areas where you think you and your founders’ technical skills give you a particular <a href="https://medium.com/entrepreneur-first/finding-your-edge-41d3950b4506">edge</a>. An example of this would be John Lewandowski, who was a PhD student in mechanical engineering and invented a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/03/technology/malaria-blood-test-device/">mechanical device to diagnose malaria</a>. It makes more sense for him to exploit his knowledge of mechanical engineering than for him to try to do develop a more biotech-based diagnostic test.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-problem">What is the problem?</h3>

<p>The poorest people in the world (those on around $2 a day or less) mainly use cash. This is costly for them to handle and it’s costly for institutions to handle, meaning that they have less access to ways of handling shocks, exploiting opportunities, and managing risk.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-possible-interventions">What are possible interventions?</h3>

<p>Digital banking and payment systems and then financial products targeted at the poor built on those systems.</p>

<h3 id="who-else-is-working-on-it">Who else is working on it?</h3>

<p>Gates Foundation, World Bank, CGAP, several tech startups.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="why-did-we-look-into-this-area">Why did we look into this area?</h2>

<p>GiveWell recommended charity <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a> uses the M-Pesa mobile money system to do its cash transfers<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and altruistic startup <a href="http://www.sendwave.com/">Sendwave</a> also uses M-Pesa to facilitate its no-fee remittance service. This tipped us off to the idea that a digital payments system could allow other promising projects to be built on top of it as well as the direct benefits of that payment system.</p>

<p>Also, financial systems are well suited to software solutions, as we can see in the developed world with e-banking and online payments.</p>

<p>Our investigation so far has consisted of reading introductory materials in the area, listed at the end.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The poor mainly use cash and usually don’t have a bank account.</p>

<p>Their use of cash is directly costly to them because it requires transportation and it is insecure. It’s indirectly costly to them because companies like banks pass on the cost of processing cash to their customers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. The poor thus tend not to have access to the formal financial system and so are limited in how they can make payments and access loans and savings products.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="who-else-is-working-on-this">Who else is working on this?</h2>

<p>The Gates Foundation has identified digitally-based financial tools for the world’s poorest as <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor">one if its goals</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cgap.org/">Consultative Group to Assist the Poor</a> is “a global partnership of 34 leading organizations that seek to advance financial inclusion”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.afi-global.org/about-us">AFI Global</a> is “a global network of financial policymakers from developing and emerging countries working together to increase access to appropriate financial services for the poor.”</p>

<p>There are also companies and charities developing technology to solve this problem.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-possible-projects">What are possible projects?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Extend mobile money systems to areas where they are less widespread. Mobile money has been widely adopted in Kenya but this level of success hasn’t been repeated elsewhere in Africa <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> and there is <a href="http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/What-makes-a-successful-mobile-money-implementation.pdf">some research</a> on what is needed for a successful mobile money implementaiton.</li>
  <li>Create digital payment systems for specific common use cases such paying remittances, salaries, or bills.</li>
  <li>Build financial services such as saving, loans, and insurance on top of existing digital finance systems such as mobile money. Target these to the needs of the very poorest.</li>
  <li>Work to remove barriers to digital finance adoption. For example lack of electricity, mobile coverage, or internet access may be obstructing adoption in some areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>The World Bank paper <a href="http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/10/27/000456286_20141027124326/Rendered/PDF/903050WP0REPLACEMENT0Box385358B00PUBLIC0.pdf">The Opportunities of Digitizing Payments</a> has a useful list of challenges for digital payments, many of which could have technical solutions.</p>

<h2 id="key-uncertainties">Key uncertainties</h2>

<p>Neglectedness: The presence of the Gates Foundation in this field suggests that it might not be very neglected. Also, there are already private companies working in this area, suggesting that the financial incentive will attract companies to solve these problems. We don’t understand the area in enough detail to spot specific subproblems that are more or less neglected.</p>

<p>Impact: We don’t have a good idea of what works and what doesn’t work in this area. For example, how beneficial is switching from cash to digital? Which financial products are most useful for the poor?</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>You can investigate this area further by:</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor">The Gates Foundation’s Financial Services for the Poor strategy overview</a> “However, the existing “bricks and mortar” banking system doesn’t work for poor people, in part because most of their transactions are conducted in cash. Handling cash transactions is costly for banks, utilities companies, and other institutions, which pass along the costs associated with storing, transporting, and processing cash to their customers.” <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>“The unbanked are people without formal bank accounts who operate in a cash economy; they are limited in their ability to take loans, maintain savings, or make remote payments (MEDHI &amp; RATAN, 2009)” - <a href="103-120.http://repec.idate.fr/RePEc/idt/journl/CS8605/CS86_TOBBIN.pdf">Tobbin, Peter. “The Adoption of ‘Transformational Mobile Banking’ by the Unbanked: An Exploratory Field Study.” <em>Communications &amp; Strategies</em> 86 (2012)</a> <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>“So far the most successful deployment of transformational m-banking services is Safricom’s M-PESA in Kenya (MORAWCZYNSKI &amp; PICKENS, 2009). Since its launch in March 2007 it has been adopted by 11.7m customers (corresponding to 54% of Kenya’s adult population and 73% of Safaricom’s subscriber base). It processes more transactions domestically than Western Union does globally (MAS &amp; RADCLIFFE, 2010). However, the success story of M-Pesa in Kenya has yet to be repeated anywhere else in Africa.” - <a href="103-120.http://repec.idate.fr/RePEc/idt/journl/CS8605/CS86_TOBBIN.pdf">Tobbin, Peter. “The Adoption of ‘Transformational Mobile Banking’ by the Unbanked: An Exploratory Field Study.” <em>Communications &amp; Strategies</em> 86 (2012)</a> <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
