description: Climate change could cause widespread damage to future generations. There is also a non-negligible chance of catastrophic harm. Part of the solution to this is to develop cleaner ways to produce energy.

### Projects to address this

Bret Victor’s excellent [What can a technologist do about climate change?](http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange) suggests the following software-related projects:

* [Control systems for clean power generation machines](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-stuff)
* [Data gathering and modelling to predict optimal placement of wind and solar generators](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-computation)
* [Energy-networking: routing of energy through the grid, especially a future grid that has many fluctuating sources of power](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#moving-networking)

### Skills you might want on your team

* Data science
* Networking technology
* Mechanical and electrical engineering

### Why this might have exceptional impact

* Scale: Climate change could have very bad or catastrophic long-term consequences for all people on Earth.
* Tractability: Novel technology is often required but there are companies already succeeding in this area.
* Neglectedness: A lot is already spent on climate change, so you’d need to find an unusually neglected sub-problem.
