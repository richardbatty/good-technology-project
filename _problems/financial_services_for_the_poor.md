### Projects to address this

* Create digital payment systems for specific common use cases such as remittances, salaries, and bills.
* Build financial services such as saving, loans, and insurance on top of existing digital finance systems such as mobile money. Target these to the needs of the very poorest.

### Skills you might want on your team

* Mobile app development
* Financial systems expertise
* UX design, especially given cultural differences

### Why this might have exceptional impact

* Scale: [In 2012, 12.7 percent of the world’s population lived at or below $1.90 a day](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview). Helping these people achieve even a small boost to their ability to buy what they need can have a very large impact on their lives.
* Tractability: Because of the rise of mobile money it’s now possible for startups to build financial business to serve many poor people even when they don’t have a bank account.
* Neglectedness: There is huge inequality of access to financial services. However, there is already a lot of work currently trying to fix this, including [funding from the Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor) and [many](https://www.sendwave.com) [private](https://branch.co/) [companies](http://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/do-more-with-m-pesa/m-shwari).
