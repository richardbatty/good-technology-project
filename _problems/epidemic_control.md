### Projects to address this

* Build outbreak detection systems that use data to detect outbreaks from non-medical data such as social media or movement data
* Build better tools for communicating public health data to decision-makers during an outbreak
* Build a system that pulls data from hospital medical records into public health monitoring systems

### Skills you might want on your team

* Data science, processing, or visualisation
* Web development
* Expertise in public health and epidemiology

### Why this might have exceptional impact

* Scale: Epidemics already kill millions of people. Recent biotechnology progress makes accedental or deliberate epidemics [a serious threat](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/biosecurity).
* Tractability: There are [operating](http://bluedot.global/) [businesses](http://www.epidemico.com/) in this area. However, itâ€™s difficult to know what interventions will work best and difficult to get feedback on whether you are successfully helping prevent outbreaks.
* Neglectedness: Government departments, such as the US CDC, international organisations, such as WHO, and academics are also working on this.
