Personal fit with project the is incredibly important in startup founders. 
Startup work is demanding: it typically involves working long hours for several years,
with the prospect of a high failure rate even if you do keep going.
This can be understandably [demoralizing](http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html),
so a good personal fit with the project improves your chances of success both by
making you more effective at the object level work, and by preventing failure
due to loss of motivation[^others].

[^others]: See [other](https://80000hours.org/2014/10/interview-holden-karnofsky-on-the-importance-of-personal-fit/) [people](https://80000hours.org/articles/personal-fit/) talking about personal fit.

However, this thows some doubt on our strategy here at GTP. Our current plan is
to find high-impact opportunities for entrepreneurship, and then direct skilled
people into them. But if personal fit is particularly important, then that adds
another filter between us and a successful project. Not only do we have to find
a person with the right values, and the right skills, we *also* have to find
someone who has the right fit with the project.

This may be difficult for us to do systematically, because there might be a
mismatch between the kinds of project which we find to have a high impact, and
the kinds of entrepreneurs whom we can find. If we can only find
entrepreneurial web developers, but the biggest impact is to be found in developing world
energy enterprises, then we'll miss out on the best opportunities.

That suggests a different tack. Rather than looking
for skilled people who already share our values, perhaps we should look for
skilled people with good personal fit for a project, and then try to persuade them that they
should work on that project. This is a qualitatively different
strategy - the people we want to reach may need to be convinced that it's right
to evaluate projects on their effectiveness, for example. That means we'd end up
doing much more values-based outreach.

The most troubling source of mismatch is in developing world
experience. It seems likely that many of the highest-impact projects will be
based in the developing world, and a common refrain is that it is
difficult to start a project in the developing world without having significant
experience of living and working there. But our initial sources of potential
entrepreneurs are mostly drawn from our contacts, and people within effective
altruism - and these tend to be disproportionately white, from developed
countries, and with skills in software rather than other engineering
disciplines. So it seems relatively unlikely that we will find people with very
good fit for a developing world project. 

Nonetheless, it's difficult to establish whether there is a mismatch between our
available pool of potential entrepreneurs and our recommended projects without
exploring both of these in more detail. We are sufficiently uncertain about both
of these things that it's hard to judge *a priori* whether we should expect
there to be a mismatch. So our current plan is to continue as we are for now,
but we're going be aware of this problem, and consider altering our strategy if
it looks like we're having problems with fit.
