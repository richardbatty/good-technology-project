        <title>Portfolios of the Poor book summary</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-book-is-about&quot;&gt;What the book is about&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/&quot;&gt;Portolios of the Poor&lt;/a&gt; tries to answer the question ‘How do the poor live on $2 a day?’. It’s based on regular interviews with over 250 families in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa which allowed the researchers to build up a detailed picture of the financial transactions these families made. Their main argument is that the poor have sophisticated financial lives. They use many different financial tools that together create ‘financial portfolios’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/pdf/Chapter1.pdf&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt; is available online if you want to get an overview. If you get the book, the most important chapters to read for an overview are chapters one and seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poor-peoples-incomes-are-low-and-irregular&quot;&gt;Poor people’s incomes are low and irregular&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People on low incomes have problems not only because they have little money, but also because that their earnings are irregular as they are often casually or self employed. The well-publicised idea of the poor living on $2 a day or less means people often don’t realise that variability of income is a big problem for the poor as well as low income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poor-people-use-many-financial-tools-to-cope-and-often-create-their-own&quot;&gt;Poor people use many financial tools to cope and often create their own&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;no matter where we looked, we found that most of the households, even those living on less than one dollar a day per person, rarely consume every penny of income as soon as it is earned. They seek, instead, to “manage” their money by saving when they can and borrowing when they need to. They don’t always succeed, but over time, even for the poorest households, a surprisingly large proportion of income gets managed in this way—diverted into savings or used to pay down loans. In the process, a host of different methods are pressed into use: storing savings at home, with others, and with banking institutions; joining savings clubs, savings-and-loan clubs, and insurance clubs; and borrowing from neighbors, relatives, employers, moneylenders, or financial institutions. At any one time, the average poor household
has a fistful of financial relationships on the go.
– p.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also create their own financial instruments. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_savings_and_credit_association&quot;&gt;RoSCAs&lt;/a&gt; are commonly used as a saving method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a RoSCA the members save the same amount as each other every period - a month, say - and the total amount saved each period is given in whole to one of the members. This continues until everyone has received the “prize” at which point the RoSCA comes naturally to a close - though of course its members may choose to start another cycle immediately or at any later time. – p. 116&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that poor people are creating their own financial instruments suggests that there could be demand for projects that either assist them in this or create better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-needs-drive-much-of-the-financial-activity-of-poor-households&quot;&gt;Three needs drive much of the financial activity of poor households&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Managing basics&lt;/em&gt;: cash-flow management to transform irregular income flows into a dependable resource to meet daily needs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coping with risk&lt;/em&gt;: dealing with the emergencies that can derail families with little in reserve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raising lump sums&lt;/em&gt;: seizing opportunities and paying for bigticket expenses by accumulating usefully large sums of money. – p. 18&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three needs don’t map cleanly onto borrowing, insurance, and saving as you might expect. Instead, poor households combine many different instruments to meet their needs. For example, they may use both saving and borrowing to manage day-to-day cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-financial-instruments-available-to-the-poor-are-often-low-quality&quot;&gt;The financial instruments available to the poor are often low quality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the dominance of the informal sector in the lives of our diary households should not be interpreted to mean that poor households are happy with the instruments available and have no need of anything else. Far from it. – p. 53&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They argue that informal financial instruments have these main weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unreliability&lt;/em&gt;: Informal financial partners are often poor themselves and so may not have the money you need, when you need it or they may not follow through on their promises. Insecurity is also a problem, with savings sometimes lost or stolen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of privacy&lt;/em&gt;: Financial relationships with family and friends can be stressful and a source of shame.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of transparency&lt;/em&gt;: The terms of the financial arrangement such as interest are not always clear and people can easily be defrauded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-poor-cant-rely-on-only-insurance-to-manage-risks&quot;&gt;The poor can’t rely on only insurance to manage risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;there are so many risks, resulting in so many emergencies, that it is unrealistic to expect poor households to contain them by means of the single financial strategy of insurance. Dealing with emergencies is so crucial that even where insurance is available to them, poor households often have to draw down savings and seek loans to make up the losses in full. – p. 19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-area-is-fast-growing-and-may-not-be-neglected&quot;&gt;This area is fast growing and may not be neglected&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Financial services for poor people - that is, microfinance, as provision of these services has become known - is enjoying unprecedented growth. New resources of all sorts are pouring in from every side. More and more providers are setting up shop in more and more countries around the world, some of them fired up by the vision of improving the lives of the poor, others lured by the prospects of profits, and many - the so-called double bottom line institutions - attracted by both. In the last few years, the level of private financial investment has increased sharply so that microfinance is no longer so dependent on the public purse. New technologies, especially mobile devices in the hands of field staff and clients, and smart computer programs in the back offices of providers, promise huge boosts to productivity, lower costs, and greater convenience. Ideas for new financial products for the poor are being launched almost daily, and clever ways of testing their efficiency and their impact are being devised. – p. 175&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-opportunities-to-help&quot;&gt;The opportunities to help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-poor-households-manage-money-on-a-day-to-day-basis&quot;&gt;Helping poor households manage money on a day-to-day basis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would involve helping households manipulate “small and irregular or unreliable incomes to ensure that cash is available when needed” to pay for small regular expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution for this should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;offer poor households access to a cash-flow management facility that combines convenience with capacity. It would provide the chance to make small-scale savings of any value at any time with the right to withdraw on demand; and at the same time it would offer loans of a modest value that can be taken quickly, on demand, at any time, and repaid in small (and if necessary, irregular) installments. – p. 178&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-poor-households-build-savings-over-the-long-term&quot;&gt;Helping poor households build savings over the long term&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor people want to save and often have enough money to, and their use of savings clubs like the RoSCAs show that they do save. But existing methods like savings clubs don’t work well over the long term. Long term savings are important for dealing with big events like marriages, purchasing large assets, and dealing with emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a solution should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;offer long term contractual savings products. These mimic savings clubs by making it possible to save small sums on a regular basis, but add the opportunity of doing so safely over the long term. – p. 179&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-poor-households-borrow-for-all-uses&quot;&gt;Helping poor households borrow for all uses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;poor households lack dependable access to credit, especially for larger sums that are needed to deal with major life-cycle events, big purchases, and emergencies – p. 179&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a solution should offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;lending for a wide range of uses. The basic mechanisms are already available, because the development of uncollateralized lending has been the single biggest and most widespread achievement of the microfinance movement. But many microfinance providers still prefer their borrowers to use their loans for just one purpose - microenterprise. Where this is enforced, clients cannot borrow for other vital uses even when they have the cash flow to service the loans. Our own research in Bangladesh, as revealed in the previous chapter, show that many loans ostensibly taken for microenterprises are used for other purposes. It is time for microfinance not merely to face up to this reality, but to embrace the opportunity that it presents. By offering &lt;em&gt;general-purpose&lt;/em&gt; loans, matched in value and structure to the cash flows of poor households, microfinance would open up to the biggest single market it is likely to find among the poor (especially the urban poor who tend to be waged rather than self-employed), and one that would be greatly appreciated by most of our diary households. – p. 179&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principles-for-designing-a-solution&quot;&gt;Principles for designing a solution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliable&lt;/em&gt;: It “should deliver services at the promised time, in the promised amount, and at the promised price”. Most services the poor deal with are unreliable, as are their own incomes. This unreliability makes life harder and having reliable financial partners would help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Convenient&lt;/em&gt;: It should give the “chance to take and repay loans, and make and withdraw deposits, frequently, close to home or work, quickly, privately, and unobtrusively”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flexible&lt;/em&gt;: It should be flexible enough that people can use it given their cash flows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Realistic&lt;/em&gt;: It should offer regularities that promote self-discipline. For example, scheduled visits by bank workers, or planned payment schedules for loans or savings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>What can a technologist do about climate change?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a problem that could badly affect the future of humanity so we’d like to learn more about what technologists can do to tackle it. Fortunately, we recently came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange&quot;&gt;this extremely detailed essay&lt;/a&gt; on what technologists and specifically software engineers can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth reading both for its insights about tackling climate change and because it suggests technical solutions that could be applied to problems in many different cause areas. Also, we’ve taken it as inspiration for our own work at Good Technology Project - we would love to create resources as good as this for each cause area we think is promising.

        <title>Digital financial services for the poor: shallow overview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-problem&quot;&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poorest people in the world (those on around $2 a day or less) mainly use cash. This is costly for them to handle and it’s costly for institutions to handle, meaning that they have less access to ways of handling shocks, exploiting opportunities, and managing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-possible-interventions&quot;&gt;What are possible interventions?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital banking and payment systems and then financial products targeted at the poor built on those systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-else-is-working-on-it&quot;&gt;Who else is working on it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gates Foundation, World Bank, CGAP, several tech startups.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-we-look-into-this-area&quot;&gt;Why did we look into this area?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GiveWell recommended charity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; uses the M-Pesa mobile money system to do its cash transfers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and altruistic startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sendwave.com/&quot;&gt;Sendwave&lt;/a&gt; also uses M-Pesa to facilitate its no-fee remittance service. This tipped us off to the idea that a digital payments system could allow other promising projects to be built on top of it as well as the direct benefits of that payment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, financial systems are well suited to software solutions, as we can see in the developed world with e-banking and online payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our investigation so far has consisted of reading introductory materials in the area, listed at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor mainly use cash and usually don’t have a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their use of cash is directly costly to them because it requires transportation and it is insecure. It’s indirectly costly to them because companies like banks pass on the cost of processing cash to their customers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The poor thus tend not to have access to the formal financial system and so are limited in how they can make payments and access loans and savings products.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-else-is-working-on-this&quot;&gt;Who else is working on this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gates Foundation has identified digitally-based financial tools for the world’s poorest as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor&quot;&gt;one if its goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cgap.org/&quot;&gt;Consultative Group to Assist the Poor&lt;/a&gt; is “a global partnership of 34 leading organizations that seek to advance financial inclusion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afi-global.org/about-us&quot;&gt;AFI Global&lt;/a&gt; is “a global network of financial policymakers from developing and emerging countries working together to increase access to appropriate financial services for the poor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also companies and charities developing technology to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-possible-projects&quot;&gt;What are possible projects?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extend mobile money systems to areas where they are less widespread. Mobile money has been widely adopted in Kenya but this level of success hasn’t been repeated elsewhere in Africa &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/What-makes-a-successful-mobile-money-implementation.pdf&quot;&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; on what is needed for a successful mobile money implementaiton.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create digital payment systems for specific common use cases such paying remittances, salaries, or bills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build financial services such as saving, loans, and insurance on top of existing digital finance systems such as mobile money. Target these to the needs of the very poorest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work to remove barriers to digital finance adoption. For example lack of electricity, mobile coverage, or internet access may be obstructing adoption in some areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/10/27/000456286_20141027124326/Rendered/PDF/903050WP0REPLACEMENT0Box385358B00PUBLIC0.pdf&quot;&gt;The Opportunities of Digitizing Payments&lt;/a&gt; has a useful list of challenges for digital payments, many of which could have technical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-uncertainties&quot;&gt;Key uncertainties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neglectedness: The presence of the Gates Foundation in this field suggests that it might not be very neglected. Also, there are already private companies working in this area, suggesting that the financial incentive will attract companies to solve these problems. We don’t understand the area in enough detail to spot specific subproblems that are more or less neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impact: We don’t have a good idea of what works and what doesn’t work in this area. For example, how beneficial is switching from cash to digital? Which financial products are most useful for the poor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can investigate this area further by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading the Gates Foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor&quot;&gt;strategy overview on financial services for the poor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/&quot;&gt;Portfolios of the Poor&lt;/a&gt;. This book explains in depth how the poor manage their finances and the problems they face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pooreconomics.com/&quot;&gt;Poor Economics&lt;/a&gt; Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9. This is particularly useful as it explains some of the weaknesses of existing financial services for the poor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading the World Bank’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/10/27/000456286_20141027124326/Rendered/PDF/903050WP0REPLACEMENT0Box385358B00PUBLIC0.pdf&quot;&gt;The Opportunities of Digitizing Payments&lt;/a&gt; which clearly outlines the benefits of digital payments and barriers to their spread.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talking to someone at one of the institutions listed in the section ‘Who else is working on this?’ above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going to a developing world country and talking to potential customers to understand the problems they face, perhaps following the methodology outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://theleanstartup.com/&quot;&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-By-Step/dp/0984999302&quot;&gt;The Startup Owners Manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; and tell us you’re thinking of working on this problem. We’ll help you with your research and strategy and put you in contact with relevant people we know.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>ACM Dev: Impressions and Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://acmdev.org/&quot;&gt;ACM Dev&lt;/a&gt; conference this year, which by
good fortune was happening in London! We’ll be putting up our notes
shortly&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:public&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:public&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but this blog post will discuss some of the higher-level
considerations that came up as a result of the conference.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hammer-seeking-nails&quot;&gt;A hammer seeking nails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of the conference was the GAIA (Global Access to the Internet for
All) workshop. There was a lot of good technical work at the workshop, and it
was encouraging to see empirical evaluations of the effectiveness of the
projects. However there was little discussion about whether the projects actually
improved welfare, or indeed whether they had an effect sustainably or
counterfactually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably to be expected from a workshop that is specifically about
extending internet access to all, but it was the first occurrence of a recurring
theme: as technologists, we are in danger of being the person with a hammer who
is looking for nails, without considering whether that is what is
currently most in need of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider this to be a serious problem. Why &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; we focus on problems
that are addressable by technology (or, more narrowly, software)? Shouldn’t we
look for the most pressing problems in any field, and then consider what we can
do about those? We’re still thinking about what the implications are for our
strategy, and we’ll discuss those in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-the-needs&quot;&gt;Start with the needs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing the project, a common observation was that it can be very
difficult to accurately discern the needs of those on the ground. Arguably,
there is no substitute for actually living in Africa to become acquainted with
the needs of people who live there. Ken Banks, in particular, was even critical
of directed surveys - people will tell you what they think you want to hear,
and so in order to really find the problems you have to actually &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; them
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is wise advice whenever you are starting a project - many successful
businesses are based on the needs that their founders saw, personally. And so
we would certainly agree that it’s important to start from the needs of the
people you will actually be helping (rather than starting with your “hammer”).
But such knowledge may be transferrable. There are many people working in the
field, and it’s unlikely that they are acting upon all (or even the most
pressing) of the problems they have observed. We should still expect to be able
to generate fruitful communication (and collaboration) between those people and
people who would be interested in implementing their suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by aggregating this information we can start to evaluate and
prioritize possible courses of action. While being on the ground may be very
helpful for spotting &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; problem, it’s unlikely to lead you directly to the
&lt;em&gt;most important&lt;/em&gt; problem. To discover that, we need to bring together the work
and observations of many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-realistic-about-the-environment&quot;&gt;Be realistic about the environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa has astonishing mobile phone penetration - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/15/cell-phones-in-africa-communication-lifeline/&quot;&gt;almost
70%&lt;/a&gt;
of Africans have a mobile phone. But far fewer of them, only 15%, are
smartphones, and mobile internet is very expensive. So for an application to
have a broad reach, even if it is built on mobile technology it must be built
on the lowest common denominator. That means voice or SMS (or maybe
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data&quot;&gt;USSD&lt;/a&gt;),
and so while an internet-based application may be appealing, it may not be
realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other logistical challenges are simply unfamiliar to most Westerners. Africa
has &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendataforafrica.org/UNWPP2015R/world-population-prospects-the-2015-revision&quot;&gt;very low population
densities&lt;/a&gt;
compared to most of the developed world, and even a simple installation process
can be a huge problem if it is a two-day drive to the installation site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politics, as well, can prove a significant barrier to implementation. Many
developing countries have government-sponsored monopolies in certain areas, and
any attempt to undercut them may be viewed quite unfavourably. In general,
technology initiatives that empower the poor are likely to upset at least some
social power structures, and failure to consider the wider social consequences
of an intervention can doom it to eventual failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the problem here is knowledge. All of this information exists
already, but it is not accessible to the right people. We should expect to need
this information to succeed, but we should also be able to acquire it by
talking to people who already know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sustainability-through-business&quot;&gt;Sustainability through business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title=&quot;ICT for Development&quot;&gt;ICT4D&lt;/abbr&gt; community is very concerned with sustainability. Many of their
projects run with limited academic funding, and so amount to pilot projects that can
fizzle out after their term is complete. This is criticized as a
failure of sustainability - if the project only runs for a short time, then it
has not changed anything in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilot programs are certainly vital, especially in research. It may be
necessary to investigate and evaluate many options before the best solution is
found. However, once we’ve hit on a good solution, we want to implement it with
a long-term sustainable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best option seems to be to turn the program into an actual business.
Businesses are inherently sustainable as long as they are able to sustain their
profitability (and if they can’t, perhaps the need for the program has passed).
Furthermore, they will naturally scale up successful interventions without the
need for additional donor funding (or if they do need funding, this can be
acquired through less constrained channels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the people we spoke to do work on spinning off their projects into
sustainable businesses, usually in collaboration with local partners. This could
be an opportunity for Western entrepreneurs to make themselves useful, either by
assisting existing spinoffs, or by taking over directly from the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation in business models could also be very valuable by allowing more
programs to be feasible as businesses. Programs which have a high social impact
but are difficult to run as a for-profit business can only be implemented by
non-profits, with all the sustainability problems that that entails. If we can
expand the sphere of potential businesses we open up more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-we-expect-to-be-better-than-the-poor-themselves&quot;&gt;Why should we expect to be better than the poor themselves?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that people in developing countries are often astonishingly
entrepreneurial. They do very creative things with the resources available to
them, and often find niches for profitable businesses in remarkable places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, access to the internet and computing resources are also spreading.
That all adds up to a climate in which we might expect African entrepreneurs to
fill many of the needs that might be filled by a Western technologist. So we
should have good reasons to believe that we can supply a need better than the
local market, whether would do that with a novel business or a non-market
solution. Why do we think we can do better than the people on the ground?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pertinent question, and in many cases if a niche hasn’t been filled we
should take that as a tip that perhaps it’s not as good an opportunity as we
thought, or that there is some obstacle which is currently invisible to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are still things which Westerners have to offer. For one thing,
we have access to resources that the poor still do not, whether that be
capital, markets, greater pools of talent, knowledge, or just coordination.
There may well be high-impact opportunities in spreading access to these tools
(for example, running programming training courses), thus enhancing the ability
of locals to solve their own problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, many opportunities may have mixed benefits, in that while they are
profitable, they also have a large amount of positive spillover. The lack of
profitability can be because it is difficult to capture the value of the
program, perhaps because the beneficiaries are very distributed (as is common
with infrastructure projects), or because the value accrues in the longer-term
future (as may be the case with education programs). We should expect such
market failures to be relatively undersupplied relative to opportunities that
are more profitable. But from the point of view of the altruistic entrepreneur,
these are ideal opportunities, because positive externalities are also
desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that there’s a lot we can learn from the &lt;abbr title=&quot;ICT for Development&quot;&gt;ICT4D&lt;/abbr&gt; sector. We’re
optimistic that we’ll find some useful opportunities here, and we’ll be writing
more about this area, as well as the implications for our strategy going forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:public&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We intend to make all of our notes and materials publically available, even if they’re provisional or later revised. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:public&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>The Good Technology Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s become a truism that technology is the most powerful lever that we have to change the world. As with any powerful lever, it’s up to us to actually use that power to make the world a better place. Moreover, we should aim to do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effectivealtruism.org&quot;&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; good we can, rather than just &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has great potential for good, both in and out of the for-profit sector. Widespread access to novel technologies can cheaply give whole populations access to capabilities that they previously did not have, or increase the efficiency of common processes.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects can be quite significant indeed. M-pesa, a mobile banking enterprise formed by Vodafone and Safaricom, has not only been a wildly successful business, but has radically reduced corruption and waste in Kenya’s banking system. M-pesa was only possible because of its use of mobile technology, and we should expect many more such opportunities as novel technologies spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you decide that you do want to start a technology project for good, there are very few resources available to help you evaluate the social impact of your ideas, or to provide suggestions. As a result, a great deal of effort is wasted and many opportunities are neglected. Lacking the information and tools to make these decisions well, founders and firms may end up backing projects that have unknown or limited impact, or not even attempting to quantify impact at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, our goal is to answer the question “How can we do as much good as possible with technology?”. Concretely, we plan to attack the problem by providing resources for individuals and firms trying to evaluate the impact of technology projects. This will help altruistic founders trying to pick good target areas, as well as existing enterprises that want to measure and refine their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concretely, we’ll be starting by interviewing experts and creating case studies of existing high-impact technology projects, and in the long term we hope to provide a guide to assessing the impact of your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-we-mean-by-technology&quot;&gt;What do we mean by “technology”?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By “technology” we mean to include both software and more directly “physical” technology, as well as business and enterprises that make large use of technologies that have become recently available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re likely to be focussing on software in the short term, as that is our area of expertise, but in principle we’d like to include other areas of technical innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-care&quot;&gt;Why should you care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re working in technology and interested in doing the most good that you can with your work, then we hope that we may be able to help you make achieve that goal in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re already working on a project that you think has a positive social impact, then please &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;, as we’d love to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
