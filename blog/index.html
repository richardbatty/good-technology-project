<p><em>Lauren Haynes is a senior project manager at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy (<a href="http://dsapp.org/">DSAPP</a>) at the University of Chicago. We talked to her to know more about the potential of data science for doing good.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about your journey so far in applying technology for good?</strong></p>

<p>I have a degree in general engineering from UIUC with a minor in computer science and human-computer interaction. While in college, I was quite involved with <a href="http://dsapp.org/">Alternative Spring Break</a> and went on seven service trips. I then went on to work with Accenture Technology Labs where I was involved with cutting edge research projects. I always had an inclination towards social good - so when one of my colleagues invited me to join <a href="http://www.theounce.org/">Ounce of Prevention Fund</a>, which does a lot of work in the area of early childhood education, I gladly accepted. As the IT Manager there, I revamped the IT infrastructure of the organization and also catered to its technology needs. At the Ounce, I also got a chance to gain an understanding of the internal dynamics of the working of an NGO. I then went to work as the product manager at <a href="http://www.giveforward.com/">GiveForward</a> - a crowdfunding platform for compassionate giving. This role was unique and enjoyable since it had both a high technology component as well as a high social good component. Since last May, I have been working with the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship (<a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu/">DSSG</a>) wherein we get 42 undergrad and graduate students each year to do data science projects for nonprofits and government agencies. The projects topics run the gamut from education, healthcare, environment, public safety, criminal justice… you name it. Some examples of problems we tackle in our program are prediction questions e.g. which participants are likely to drop out of a program; another example would be resource allocation questions e.g. we can inspect only a 100 buildings out of a 1000 - which ones are most likely to be noncompliant. I am also serving as the board vice-chair for <a href="http://alternativebreaks.org/">Break Away</a> wherein I provide guidance on using technology to efficiently manage their operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Tell us a bit about your how you got into ICT for Development (ICTD).</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://samsudar.com/">I’m a PhD student</a> at the University of Washington in Seattle. I’m doing my thesis on leveraging web tech on poorly connected regions and this is the theme throughout everything I do.</p>

<p>I started in the tech for development group working on <a href="https://opendatakit.org/">Open Data Kit</a> - a platform to help researchers and NGOs collect and manage data. The first version, which is widely used, is a way to use Excel to specify a form in native Android that looks a bit like a web form. This makes it easy to create a form and collect data from it. It’s used in over 100 countries and the Red Cross used it extensively after the Haiti earthquake. I was involved in <a href="https://opendatakit.org/use/2_0_tools/">Open Data Kit 2.0</a> which has the same functionality but in JavaScript and HTML to make more it more customizable. I’m not as involved in that now, but the paper on <a href="https://samsudar.com/static/sudar_2015_duces.pdf">simplifying mobile deployments in low resource settings</a> that I presented at the <a href="http://acmdev.org/">London ICTD conference</a> was motivated by that work. It came out of dealing with researchers who I often felt tried to overcomplicate things.</p>

<p>Last summer I interned at Google working in the Chrome for emerging regions group.</p>

          Persistently neglected causes

      <div class="post-exerpt">
        <p>A heuristic that we often use when assessing causes is that of <em>neglectedness</em>.
If a cause is neglected, then that means that it is not receiving an amount of
attention commensurate to it’s seriousness. Given that most causes suffer from
diminishing marginal returns on investment, if less has been invested then we
should expect there to be especially cost-effective projects still available.</p>

<p>But not all neglectedness is made equal. Some causes are only neglected
<em>transiently</em>. That is, they aren’t receiving
much attention now, but it’s clear that that will change in the relatively near
future. An example is mobile services for the poor. This area has been
neglected for a long time because the infrastructure and the handset penetration
were not there, but that that is <a href="http://guardian.ng/technology/africas-mobile-phone-penetration-now-67/">changing</a>.
Hence, interest is picking up, and
we should expect to see an increasing amount of resources directed there over
the coming years. So it’s likely that many potential projects in this
area will happen anyway in the next couple of decades.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyletter.com/goodcode">Good code</a> is a meetup in London of software developers who work on projects for effective charities.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-good-code-get-started-what-are-you-trying-to-do">How did good code get started? What are you trying to do?</h2>

<p>I was interested in technology entrepreneurship and I wanted to do a lot of good. I thought a good potential customer for this would be poor people or charities that help them, especially as there is little incentive for other organisations to help them out. I didn’t know much about this area though, so I set up Good Code to explore what kinds of problems charities have that could be solved by tech. We approach charities that seem high impact (e.g. from <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> recommendations) and then find out what sort of problems they have that could be solved with software. It’s been a good way to start conversations with charities because we’re offering something of use to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/">Portolios of the Poor</a> tries to answer the question ‘How do the poor live on $2 a day?’. It’s based on regular interviews with over 250 families in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa which allowed the researchers to build up a detailed picture of the financial transactions these families made. Their main argument is that the poor have sophisticated financial lives. They use many different financial tools that together create ‘financial portfolios’.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/pdf/Chapter1.pdf">Chapter 1</a> is available online if you want to get an overview. If you get the book, the most important chapters to read for an overview are chapters one and seven.</p>

<p>It’s worth reading both for its insights about tackling climate change and because it suggests technical solutions that could be applied to problems in many different cause areas. Also, we’ve taken it as inspiration for our own work at Good Technology Project - we would love to create resources as good as this for each cause area we think is promising.</p>

<p>The poorest people in the world (those on around $2 a day or less) mainly use cash. This is costly for them to handle and it’s costly for institutions to handle, meaning that they have less access to ways of handling shocks, exploiting opportunities, and managing risk.</p>

        <p>It’s become a truism that technology is the most powerful lever that we have to change the world. As with any powerful lever, it’s up to us to actually use that power to make the world a better place. Moreover, we should aim to do the <a href="http://www.effectivealtruism.org">most</a> good we can, rather than just <em>some</em> good.</p>

<p>Technology has great potential for good, both in and out of the for-profit sector. Widespread access to novel technologies can cheaply give whole populations access to capabilities that they previously did not have, or increase the efficiency of common processes.</p>
