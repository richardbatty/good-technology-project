          ICT for international development: an interview with Sam Sudar
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Apr 29, 2016 &#183; Richard Batty </span>
      </a>
      <div class="post-exerpt">
        <p><strong>Tell us a bit about your how you got into ICT for Development (ICTD).</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://samsudar.com/">I’m PhD student</a> at the University of Washington in Seattle. I’m doing my thesis on leveraging web tech on poorly connected regions and this is the theme throughout everything I do.</p>

<p>I started in the tech for development group working on <a href="https://opendatakit.org/">Open Data Kit</a> - a platform to help researchers and NGOs collect and manage data. The first version, which is widely used, is a way to use Excel to specify a form in native Android that looks a bit like a web form. This makes it easy to create a form and collect data from it. It’s used in over 100 countries and the Red Cross used it extensively after the Haiti earthquake. I was involved in <a href="https://opendatakit.org/use/2_0_tools/">Open Data Kit 2.0</a> which has the same functionality but in JavaScript and HTML to make more it more customizable. I’m not as involved in that now, but the paper on <a href="https://samsudar.com/static/sudar_2015_duces.pdf">simplifying mobile deployments in low resource settings</a> that I presented at the <a href="http://acmdev.org/">London ICTD conference</a> was motivated by that work. It came out of dealing with researchers who I often felt tried to overcomplicate things.</p>

<p>Last summer I interned at Google working in the Chrome for emerging regions group.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I was in Peru working with researchers who have a medical boat which goes up some of the Amazonian rivers to provide medical care for remote communities. I built an app that allows community agents in these remote communities to submit Open Data Kit forms via SMS. It turned out that they preferred WhatsApp to SMS and were talking directly to the doctors using it. That was working much better and the users were buying into it a lot more. So I was down there assessing cell signal and then this week I built a new version of the app that uses WhatsApp rather than SMS.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think of the argument that it might be higher impact to use older technologies because remaining opportunities involving old technology may not get as much attention because they’re unfashionable?</strong></p>

<p>I agree and the work I’ve done thus far is not the bleeding edge - more like novel ways to use existing technologies. However, there are people who do more complicated things. For example <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~shaddi/">Shaddi Hasan</a> started <a href="https://www.endaga.com/">Endaga</a> which sets up cell phone towers in remote places like Papua, Indonesia and they recently got bought by Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is neglected in ICTD? Where would you direct resources?</strong></p>

<p>Not sure I have an answer, but a broad thing I’ve noticed is that the bigger problems are understanding how to use existing technology. Many of the existing problems that global health researchers have are not things that need new applications to solve. It’s more that they don’t have a good sense of what’s possible and what’s an easy way to do things, and even if they had an idea of that they wouldn’t know how to go about doing it.</p>

<p>It would be good if you could set up a website that provides step-by-step instructions on how to solve common problems in international development with technology. For example, ‘If you need to do data collection, here are the components and here’s how you set them up.’ Data collection is particularly amenable to this because you don’t need a programmer. As long as you know the tools to use and are computer literate and you could piece it together. Perhaps you could have instructions for a bunch of other common problems like this.</p>

<p><strong>Why don’t people in development know what’s possible in tech and why don’t they hire tech people?</strong></p>

<p>People in international development often value involvement of tech beyond the added value that tech brings. If they have a project and they think they could involve tech, that makes it sexier. The decision to involve technology is more of a knee-jerk reaction than something that comes after thinking ‘What do we really need technology for?’</p>

<p>Also, there is a shortage of people who have a good breadth of technical skills to be able to put all the parts of a solution together and to be able to advise on what is difficult and what is easy.</p>

<p><strong>Why aren’t those people in development organisations?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know whether or not those kinds of people are being hired. But I know it’s expensive to do anything involving code and so often only the biggest organisations can afford it and these big organisations are less inclined to open-source their work and document what they did.</p>

<p>I think people often don’t know how to apply technology - it’s can be a bit of a hammer looking for a nail. There are cases like data collection where it works well, but other cases where it doesn’t work so well - such as when people build one-off applications. People don’t think ‘If only we had an app to do this’ because they don’t know what they need. Tech can be helpful but it’s not the missing link.</p>

<p>On the Open Data Kit message board there is a mix of people. Some people have well thought-out questions. And then there’s other people who don’t know how to get started because they need basic IT support and it’s hard to do that remotely. It’s also often hard to get a sense of what people want from tech. There is often disagreement within the organisation about what is wanted. It’s then very difficult to come in and solve their problems with technology because they don’t know what they want. Rarely do people have a problem that is well-specified. It’s more like ‘There is something that is hard for us, how can we make this easier’.</p>

<p>If the Good Technology Project had something where people could submit a request for help, that would be useful. It would need to filter out people who are not serious. But if you force people to put some effort then you could have tech people respond. That’s missing more than building code. For example, in Peru they had stopped using WhatsApp because every 3 months if you don’t upgrade WhatsApp it locks you out until you upgrade. Everyone using the app thought it was broken. I was baffled - I was expecting to be surprised, but I was surprised even more because it said clearly what the problem was.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think of the approach of academia to ICTD as compared to other groups?</strong></p>

<p>I am not thrilled with the academic approach. There are often a lot of throwaway prototypes and overreaching claims. It’s a weird space because people are doing work trying to solve real problems but they aren’t bound to deliver anything.</p>

<p>It’s rare to find a project that actually productizes a prototype that a paper was published about. Most people don’t have the resources or time to productize it and it’s really hard to do. It’s hard to release a project that is based on an academic project.</p>

<p>The alternative to that is a paper that may or may not work. I think if you don’t release the code you say you ran I’m suspicious. Especially in ICTD you have a problem where the paper says something works but you don’t actually know that. For example, people are really into SMS reminders at the moment. There are projects, but it takes more decision making and work than people realise. Just because a paper shows one can do something, doesn’t mean you can do it easily. Often people believe it can be done effortlessly and someone else can maintain it for free.</p>

<p><strong>Who does the best work in this field?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve heard great things about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/">Microsoft Research India</a>. They have a good reputation and seem to do stuff that does work. My favorite project of theirs one to make sure TB patients actually took their pills. They printed codes in pill containers so you when you push out the pill you can see the code and text it in.</p>

<p>I like what the Chrome team at Google does (although I’m biased) with <a href="https://chrome.googleblog.com/2015/11/a-new-way-to-save-data-with-chrome-on.html">data saver</a>. You can turn on an option in Chrome for Android that will send all of your traffic to a server they run then it compresses the data and prefetches things which speeds it up and lowers data use. They’ve got <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub43447.html">a paper about it</a>. If this was an academic project there would be lots of implementation problems, but Google has managed to solve them.</p>

<p>Consultants can also do well because they have the resources to do projects that they know they can meet the requirements of. It’s very expensive though.</p>

<p><strong>What are the career paths in this field?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest thing is getting experience with groups that think they need some sort of technological assistance. It would be good if there was a way to put NGOs in touch with tech people, even just to answer questions on what kind of solution is needed for the NGO’s problems.</p>

<p><strong>Why doesn’t this communication between NGOs and tech people happen?</strong></p>

<p>Global health researchers usually don’t think to turn to the web and try to find someone to help. Often researchers don’t realise that they don’t need something complicated and just need someone to walk through things. The flip side of this is the Gates Foundation who will just hire a consultant and they can pay, and the consultants expect to get paid. But I think there would be tech people happy to do voluntary work.</p>

<p>I think there would be more to be gained by tech people giving the lay of the land to NGOs rather than building an app. There’s more to go wrong in building an app and often the NGOs don’t know what they need.</p>

        <h3>
          Persistently neglected causes
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Apr 3, 2016 &#183; Michael Peyton Jones </span>
      </a>
      <div class="post-exerpt">
        <p>A heuristic that we often use when assessing causes is that of <em>neglectedness</em>.
If a cause is neglected, then that means that it is not receiving an amount of
attention commensurate to it’s seriousness. Given that most causes suffer from
diminishing marginal returns on investment, if less has been invested then we
should expect there to be especially cost-effective projects still available.</p>

<p>But not all neglectedness is made equal. Some causes are only neglected
<em>transiently</em>. That is, they aren’t receiving
much attention now, but it’s clear that that will change in the relatively near
future. An example is mobile services for the poor. This area has been
neglected for a long time because the infrastructure and the handset penetration
were not there, but that that is <a href="http://guardian.ng/technology/africas-mobile-phone-penetration-now-67/">changing</a>. 
Hence, interest is picking up, and
we should expect to see an increasing amount of resources directed there over
the coming years. So it’s likely that many potential projects in this
area will happen anyway in the next couple of decades.</p>

<p>If a cause is only transiently neglected then the impact of paying attention to
it is lesser. If someone else is going to do the work eventually,
then by doing it now you have simply brought that time forward.
That can be a great thing - getting a malaria vaccine even a year earlier would
be fantastic! But it’s even better if we can address a cause that is
<em>persistently</em> neglected. In that case you are bringing forward an event which
might otherwise require an unusual combination of factors to occur, and
therefore probably wouldn’t happen for a long time.</p>

<p>Why might a cause be persistently neglected? One reason can be that there are persistent
obstacles to addressing it. For example, many good things can be done by for-profit companies,
but there are a number of problems that can persistently obstruct for-profit
solutions, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The beneficiaries of the project can’t pay for it. For example, attempts to
sell high-end electronics to the poor are likely to fail, not because
the customers wouldn’t benefit from them, but because they simply can’t afford them.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to capture the value created by the project. This can happen
because the beneficiaries are not the customers. Anything with large positive externalities has this
problem, such as infrastructural projects or provision of public goods.</li>
  <li>There is a more profitable way to deliver the product to the customers that
doesn’t have as much social benefit. For example, one could sell a farmer the
ability to get to market by selling them a vehicle, or by building
a road. Selling just a vehicle may be more profitable, but the road may
benefit many other people as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>And almost any project can suffer from more general, but still persistent
problems, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The project requires unusual skills. You might need intimate knowledge of both
sub-Saharan Africa <em>and</em> modern financial markets.</li>
  <li>The project requires unusual knowledge. It is not at all obvious that
<a href="www.spacex.com/about/capabilities">you can build a cheaper rocket</a>, but Elon
Musk had reason to believe that you could.<sup id="fnref:secrets"><a href="#fn:secrets" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>The benefits of the project are systematically undervalued (e.g. because they
accrue in the far future).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these obstacles can be addressed without actually attempting the
project! If the reason that nobody is building a cheaper rocket is because they
don’t believe that it’s possible, then it may be sufficient to challenge that
belief (by argument or example). At that point, if you’ve made a convincing
enough case, the problem may become only transiently neglected: now that people
realise that it’s possible, somebody else will probably do it soon.<sup id="fnref:investment"><a href="#fn:investment" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
A lot of academic research falls into this camp - once someone has published a
proof of concept, it is only a matter of time before it is implemented.<sup id="fnref:hyperloop"><a href="#fn:hyperloop" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So the best kind of project to actually work on, all other things being equal, is one which is both
persistently neglected and which cannot be easily made only transiently
neglected. This might be because the features that make it possible for you to
address it are personal or non-transferrable - unusual skills are a
good example of this. So if you can see a project idea which you think
relatively few people would even be able to attempt successfully, then it might
be a persistently neglected area, and so worthy of extra attention.</p>

    <li id="fn:secrets">
      <p>Peter Thiel in ‘Zero to One’ refers to these as “secrets”: things
that are hard to know, and not widely believed, but are nonetheless true.
If you have a secret, it’s likely that you have access to some unusual
evidence or theory that can make you particularly suited to address
particular problems. <a href="#fnref:secrets" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:investment">
      <p>Of course, by the time you’ve demonstrated your principle, you
might have enough of a head start that it’s worth pushing on anyway! And it
may be a long road to convincing others of unusual beliefs. <a href="#fnref:investment" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I was interested in technology entrepreneurship and I wanted to do a lot of good. I thought a good potential customer for this would be poor people or charities that help them, especially as there is little incentive for other organisations to help them out. I didn’t know much about this area though, so I set up Good Code to explore what kinds of problems charities have that could be solved by tech. We approach charities that seem high impact (e.g. from <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> recommendations) and then find out what sort of problems they have that could be solved with software. It’s been a good way to start conversations with charities because we’re offering something of use to them.</p>

It’s based on regular interviews with over 250 families in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa which allowed the researchers to build up a detailed picture of the financial transactions these families made. Their main argument is that the poor have sophisticated financial lives. They use many different financial tools that together create ‘financial portfolios’.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/pdf/Chapter1.pdf">Chapter 1</a> is available online if you want to get an overview. If you get the book, the most important chapters to read for an overview are chapters one and seven.</p>
