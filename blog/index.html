          Persistently neglected causes
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Apr 3, 2016 &#183; Michael Peyton Jones </span>
      </a>
      <div class="post-exerpt">
        <p>A heuristic that we often use when assessing causes is that of <em>neglectedness</em>.
If a cause is neglected, then that means that it is not receiving an amount of
attention commensurate to it’s seriousness. Given that most causes suffer from
diminishing marginal returns on investment, if less has been invested then we
should expect there to be especially cost-effective projects still available.</p>

<p>But not all neglectedness is made equal. Some causes are only neglected
<em>transiently</em>. That is, they aren’t receiving
much attention now, but it’s clear that that will change in the relatively near
future. An example is mobile services for the poor. This area has been
neglected for a long time because the infrastructure and the handset penetration
were not there, but that that is <a href="http://guardian.ng/technology/africas-mobile-phone-penetration-now-67/">changing</a>. 
Hence, interest is picking up, and
we should expect to see an increasing amount of resources directed there over
the coming years. So it’s likely that many potential projects in this
area will happen anyway in the next couple of decades.</p>

<p>If a cause is only transiently neglected then the impact of paying attention to
it is lesser. If someone else is going to do the work eventually,
then by doing it now you have simply brought that time forward.
That can be a great thing - getting a malaria vaccine even a year earlier would
be fantastic! But it’s even better if we can address a cause that is
<em>persistently</em> neglected. In that case you are bringing forward an event which
might otherwise require an unusual combination of factors to occur, and
therefore probably wouldn’t happen for a long time.</p>

<p>Why might a cause be persistently neglected? One reason can be that there are persistent
obstacles to addressing it. For example, many good things can be done by for-profit companies,
but there are a number of problems that can persistently obstruct for-profit
solutions, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The beneficiaries of the project can’t pay for it. For example, attempts to
sell high-end electronics to the poor are likely to fail, not because
the customers wouldn’t benefit from them, but because they simply can’t afford them.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to capture the value created by the project. This can happen
because the beneficiaries are not the customers. Anything with large positive externalities has this
problem, such as infrastructural projects or provision of public goods.</li>
  <li>There is a more profitable way to deliver the product to the customers that
doesn’t have as much social benefit. For example, one could sell a farmer the
ability to get to market by selling them a vehicle, or by building
a road. Selling just a vehicle may be more profitable, but the road may
benefit many other people as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>And almost any project can suffer from more general, but still persistent
problems, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The project requires unusual skills. You might need intimate knowledge of both
sub-Saharan Africa <em>and</em> modern financial markets.</li>
  <li>The project requires unusual knowledge. It is not at all obvious that
<a href="www.spacex.com/about/capabilities">you can build a cheaper rocket</a>, but Elon
Musk had reason to believe that you could.<sup id="fnref:secrets"><a href="#fn:secrets" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>The benefits of the project are systematically undervalued (e.g. because they
accrue in the far future).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these obstacles can be addressed without actually attempting the
project! If the reason that nobody is building a cheaper rocket is because they
don’t believe that it’s possible, then it may be sufficient to challenge that
belief (by argument or example). At that point, if you’ve made a convincing
enough case, the problem may become only transiently neglected: now that people
realise that it’s possible, somebody else will probably do it soon.<sup id="fnref:investment"><a href="#fn:investment" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
A lot of academic research falls into this camp - once someone has published a
proof of concept, it is only a matter of time before it is implemented.<sup id="fnref:hyperloop"><a href="#fn:hyperloop" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So the best kind of project to actually work on, all other things being equal, is one which is both
persistently neglected and which cannot be easily made only transiently
neglected. This might be because the features that make it possible for you to
address it are personal or non-transferrable - unusual skills are a
good example of this. So if you can see a project idea which you think
relatively few people would even be able to attempt successfully, then it might
be a persistently neglected area, and so worthy of extra attention.</p>

      <p>Peter Thiel in ‘Zero to One’ refers to these as “secrets”: things
that are hard to know, and not widely believed, but are nonetheless true.
If you have a secret, it’s likely that you have access to some unusual
evidence or theory that can make you particularly suited to address
particular problems. <a href="#fnref:secrets" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:investment">
      <p>Of course, by the time you’ve demonstrated your principle, you
might have enough of a head start that it’s worth pushing on anyway! And it

<p><a href="http://tinyletter.com/goodcode">Good code</a> is a meetup in London of software developers who work on projects for effective charities.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-good-code-get-started-what-are-you-trying-to-do">How did good code get started? What are you trying to do?</h2>

<p>I was interested in technology entrepreneurship and I wanted to do a lot of good. I thought a good potential customer for this would be poor people or charities that help them, especially as there is little incentive for other organisations to help them out. I didn’t know much about this area though, so I set up Good Code to explore what kinds of problems charities have that could be solved by tech. We approach charities that seem high impact (e.g. from <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> recommendations) and then find out what sort of problems they have that could be solved with software. It’s been a good way to start conversations with charities because we’re offering something of use to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/">Portolios of the Poor</a> tries to answer the question ‘How do the poor live on $2 a day?’. It’s based on regular interviews with over 250 families in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa which allowed the researchers to build up a detailed picture of the financial transactions these families made. Their main argument is that the poor have sophisticated financial lives. They use many different financial tools that together create ‘financial portfolios’.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/pdf/Chapter1.pdf">Chapter 1</a> is available online if you want to get an overview. If you get the book, the most important chapters to read for an overview are chapters one and seven.</p>

<p>It’s worth reading both for its insights about tackling climate change and because it suggests technical solutions that could be applied to problems in many different cause areas. Also, we’ve taken it as inspiration for our own work at Good Technology Project - we would love to create resources as good as this for each cause area we think is promising.</p>

        <p>It’s become a truism that technology is the most powerful lever that we have to change the world. As with any powerful lever, it’s up to us to actually use that power to make the world a better place. Moreover, we should aim to do the <a href="http://www.effectivealtruism.org">most</a> good we can, rather than just <em>some</em> good.</p>

<p>Technology has great potential for good, both in and out of the for-profit sector. Widespread access to novel technologies can cheaply give whole populations access to capabilities that they previously did not have, or increase the efficiency of common processes.</p>
