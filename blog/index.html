<p>We want to provide a simple search tool for movies, books, games, or any piece of content that can be published by anyone in the world. The big difference is that this network is completely decentralised - it’s powered by the computers of everyone in the network.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyletter.com/goodcode">Good code</a> is a meetup in London of software developers who work on projects for effective charities.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-good-code-get-started-what-are-you-trying-to-do">How did good code get started? What are you trying to do?</h2>

<p>I was interested in technology entrepreneurship and I wanted to do a lot of good. I thought a good potential customer for this would be poor people or charities that help them, especially as there is little incentive for other organisations to help them out. I didn’t know much about this area though, so I set up Good Code to explore what kinds of problems charities have that could be solved by tech. We approach charities that seem high impact (e.g. from <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> recommendations) and then find out what sort of problems they have that could be solved with software. It’s been a good way to start conversations with charities because we’re offering something of use to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/">Portolios of the Poor</a> tries to answer the question ‘How do the poor live on $2 a day?’. It’s based on regular interviews with over 250 families in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa which allowed the researchers to build up a detailed picture of the financial transactions these families made. Their main argument is that the poor have sophisticated financial lives. They use many different financial tools that together create ‘financial portfolios’.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portfoliosofthepoor.com/pdf/Chapter1.pdf">Chapter 1</a> is available online if you want to get an overview. If you get the book, the most important chapters to read for an overview are chapters one and seven.</p>

        <p>Climate change is a problem that could badly affect the future of humanity so we’d like to learn more about what technologists can do to tackle it. Fortunately, we recently came across <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange">this extremely detailed essay</a> on what technologists and specifically software engineers can do to help.</p>

<p>It’s worth reading both for its insights about tackling climate change and because it suggests technical solutions that could be applied to problems in many different cause areas. Also, we’ve taken it as inspiration for our own work at Good Technology Project - we would love to create resources as good as this for each cause area we think is promising.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-problem">What is the problem?</h3>

<p>The poorest people in the world (those on around $2 a day or less) mainly use cash. This is costly for them to handle and it’s costly for institutions to handle, meaning that they have less access to ways of handling shocks, exploiting opportunities, and managing risk.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-possible-interventions">What are possible interventions?</h3>

<p>Digital banking and payment systems and then financial products targeted at the poor built on those systems.</p>

<h3 id="who-else-is-working-on-it">Who else is working on it?</h3>

<p>Gates Foundation, World Bank, CGAP, several tech startups.</p>

        <p>It’s become a truism that technology is the most powerful lever that we have to change the world. As with any powerful lever, it’s up to us to actually use that power to make the world a better place. Moreover, we should aim to do the <a href="http://www.effectivealtruism.org">most</a> good we can, rather than just <em>some</em> good.</p>

<p>Technology has great potential for good, both in and out of the for-profit sector. Widespread access to novel technologies can cheaply give whole populations access to capabilities that they previously did not have, or increase the efficiency of common processes.</p>
