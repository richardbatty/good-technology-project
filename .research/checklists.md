## Thinking
* Imagine what someone you respect, thinking you were wrong, would say/try to make the best argument against what you are currently thinking.
* Pay attention to the use of contradictory epistemic standards and premises on different arguments/pattern recognize them. Reconcile them or adjust your confidence in them.
* Check factual factual claims that you hear with a short Google search, and/or Wikipedia.
* Use basic arithmetic and statistics frequently and briefly as part of thinking rather than as occasional or separate exercises.
* Try to convert qualitative claims into quantitative Fermi estimates whenever possible. Fermi calculations with quick Wikipedia/Google/Wolfram/standard sources go far, and one can get into the habit and see how they typically evolve with different levels of depth.
* Note down arguments against positions you hold, in a folder

## Learning
* Understand the epistemology and basic worldview of multiple movements. I like ideological turing tests, mainly because they will highlight the best evidence for the things they like, and against the things they hate, which helps in identifying areas to look into.
