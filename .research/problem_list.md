## Financial technology for the worlds’ poorest
See our [review](http://goodtechnologyproject.org/blog/2016/01/04/digital-financial-services-for-the-poor-shallow-overview/) and [Hystra's overview](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51bef39fe4b010d205f84a92/t/51f245abe4b0475c8b40f894/1374832043586/Hystra_Rapport_ICT_for_the_BoP.pdf#page=140)

## AI Safety
Advanced artificial intelligence may pose a risk to humanity (introductions to this issue [here](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) and [here](https://intelligence.org/summary/))

80,000 Hours has outlined [ways of working on this problem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BJzvwDTEzgv7YC100SA1LuqyDzTf1Gqe4QaOz-460gA/edit#)

The main relevant methods for technologists would be:
* Technical research on creating safe AI
* Improving human decision making and intelligence so that we can better deal with the problems that AI may cause

## Biosurveillance
### The problem
> Pandemics have the potential to cause significant, and perhaps unprecedented, harm. We believe natural pandemics represent one of the biggest current risks to global welfare and stability, and the risks from engineered pandemics — whether via accidents or misuse — may grow in the future.  -- [Open Philanthropy Project](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity)

80,000 Hours has a [profile](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/biosecurity/) on how to work on this cause area.

See our [interview with Alex Demarsh](http://goodtechnologyproject.org/blog/2016/06/11/interview-with-alex-demarsh) for information on building biosurveillance systems to tackle disease outbreaks.

## Digital infrastructure for the developing world
[Developing countries have gaps in services that could be bridged with IT solutions.](https://www.ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=386)

## Tech for effective non-profits
We've heard from multiple sources that many nonprofits and academic researchers in international development don't know how technology could help their projects. It's not just that they don't know how to implement a technological solution, they don't even know what's possible in the first place.

So there could be space for a web resource or consultancy that helps nonprofits understand how to exploit technology. This organisation could then work on building the most widely-needed technology.

## Fixing science
Scientific research has lead to huge gains in welfare, but there are [ongoing problems](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21588069-scientific-research-has-changed-world-now-it-needs-change-itself-how-science-goes-wrong) such as, publication bias, bad statistical methods, and lack of open access to scientific research

## Computer security
As internet-connected systems become more widespread, gather ever more data, and act on the physical world we will need to secure them well to keep us safe.
