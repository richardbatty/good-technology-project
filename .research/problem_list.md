# List of global problems you could work on as a software technologist

## Financial services for the worlds’ poorest

### The problem
The poorest people in the world (those on around $2 a day or less) mainly use cash and this is costly for them to handle. Their poverty and lack of bank accounts makes it difficult for them to access financial services to help them handle shocks, exploit opportunities, and manage risk.

### Why this is plausibly high impact

* Scale: [In 2012, 12.7 percent of the world’s population lived at or below $1.90 a day](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview). Because these people are so poor, helping them achieve even a small boost to their ability to buy what they need can have a very large impact on their lives.
* Neglectedness: Global poverty is neglected compared to many developed-world causes. However, there is already a lot of work going into financial inclusion, including the [funding from the Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor) and [many](https://www.sendwave.com) [private](https://branch.co/) [companies](http://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/do-more-with-m-pesa/m-shwari).
* Tractabilty: Because of the rise of mobile money this has become more tractable.


### Projects to address this

* Extend mobile money systems to areas where they are less widespread.
* Create digital payment systems for specific common use cases such paying remittances, salaries, or bills.
* Build financial services such as saving, loans, and insurance on top of existing digital finance systems such as mobile money. Target these to the needs of the very poorest.

### Skills that are helpful

* Mobile app development
* Experience building financial systems
* UX design
* Developing-world experience

## Infectious disease control

### The problem
Outbreaks of disease need to be detected quickly and tracked to help health services respond effectively.

### Why this is plausibly high impact

* Scale: Epidemics and pandemics already [kill millions of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics). Accedentally or deliberately engineered epidemics [may be a threat in the future](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/biosecurity).
* Neglectedness: There are people working on this, including governments and academia.
* Tractability: It's difficult to know what interventions will work best and difficult to get feedback on whether you are successfully helping prevent outbreaks.

### Projects to address this

* Build a system that pulls data from hospital medical records into public health monitoring systems
* Build better tools for communicating public health data to decision-makers during an outbreak
* Build outbreak detection systems that use data to detect outbreaks from non-medical data such as social media or movement data

### Skills that are helpful

* Data science
* Data visualisation
* Web development
* Expertise in public health and epidemiology

## Digital infrastructure for the developing world

### The problem
[Developing countries have gaps in essential services that could be bridged using IT solutions.](https://www.ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=386) But often the tech infrastructure isn't there to enable these solutions to be built.

### Why this is plausibly high impact

* Scale: Developing-world poverty causes a great deal of suffering. Building the underlying infrastructure to support further development could multiply the effectiveness of future work. However, this indirect mechanism makes measuring impact hard.
* Neglectedness: Some people working on this, including Facebook and Google on internet infrastructure. But it's neglected compared to developed-world IT infrastructure.
* Tractability: Researchers and companies are already making progress, suggesting this is tractable.

### Projects to address this

* [A new generation of wireless broadband network technologies that rapidly cut the cost of expanding coverage to rural areas](https://www.ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=400)
* [Affordable (under $50) smartphones that support full-fledged Internet services and need limited electricity to charge](https://www.ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=401)
* [Biometric ID systems, linking birth registry, land title registry, financial services, education history, medical history, and other information critical for ICT enabled services](https://www.ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=401)
* [A new generation of ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) devices, which enable newer types of services, and compensate for gaps in infrastructure, effective institutions, and human capital ](https://www.ligtt.org/sites/all/files/page/50BTs-Consolidated.pdf#page=404)

## Energy and climate change

### The problem

Climate change could cause widespread damage to future generations. There is also a [non-negligible chance](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/) of extreme levels of warming that could be catastrophic.

### Why this is plausibly high impact

* Scale: Climate change could have very bad or catastrophic long-term consequences for all people on Earth.
* Neglectedness: A lot is already spent on climate change, so you'd need to find an unusually neglected sub-problem.
* Tractability: Novel technology is often required but there are companies already succeeding in this area.

### Projects to address this

Bret Victor's excellent [What can a technologist do about climate change?](http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange) suggests the following software-related projects.

* [Control systems for clean power generation machines](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-stuff)

### Skills that are helpful

* Data science
* Networking technology
* Hardware

## Tech for effective nonprofits

### The problem

Many international development and global health nonprofits don't know how to use technology effectively to help with problems they face.

### Why this is plausibly high impact

* Scale: Multiplying the effectiveness of international development charities, especially those that are already highly effective, could have a large effect.
* Neglectedness: There are tech consultants working in this area, but it is widely thought that people in this area don't have a good understanding of how to use technology effectively.
* Tractability: This doesn't require new technology, just an understanding of how to apply existing technology.

### Projects to address this

* A consultancy that advises non-profits on their technology strategy
* A website that provides step-by-step instructions on how to solve common problems in international development with technology

### Skills that are helpful

* Web development
* Mobile development
* Developing world experience

From Bret Victor's [What can a technologist do about climate change?](http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange)

* [Technical computing language development](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#tools-technical)
* [Languages specifically designed for particular causes, such as climate modelling](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#tools-modeling)

* [Tools for discovering problems and evaluating ideas](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#tools-finding) [This is what GTP is for!]
* [Tools for improving people's understanding about important issues](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#media)

## Tech for effective non-profits
We've heard from multiple sources that many nonprofits and academic researchers in international development don't know how technology could help their projects. It's not just that they don't know how to implement a technological solution, they don't even know what's possible in the first place.

So there could be space for a web resource or consultancy that helps nonprofits understand how to exploit technology. This organisation could then work on building the most widely-needed technology.

## Fixing science
Scientific research has lead to huge gains in welfare, but there are [ongoing problems](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21588069-scientific-research-has-changed-world-now-it-needs-change-itself-how-science-goes-wrong) such as, publication bias, bad statistical methods, and lack of open access to scientific research

## Computer security
As internet-connected systems become more widespread, gather ever more data, and act on the physical world we will need to secure them well to keep us safe.
