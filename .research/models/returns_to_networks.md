Once you have lots of autonomous cars, the autonomous cars don't need to be as good. e.g. their sensors can break down and still do OK by asking other cars for information.

Similarly, if you want to use your phone to understand a scene, it could do all the image processing itself or it could ask a phone that's done it before.
